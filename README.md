Appsci website

## Issues
- Firebase DNS instructions said to set host to `appsci.dev` for A and TXT records, which did not work. Setting it to `@` worked.
- Redirects directly to pdf files don't work

## Debug
To run local firebase hostiing simulator: `firebase emulators:start` and go to http://localhost:5000. Currently busted.
